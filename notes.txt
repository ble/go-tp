Where does it belong?

HTML page
  convenient namespacing
  sends a test chat
  making the following happen in an appropriate, async fashion,
  keyed off of the `fetchState` success:
    start the game if it hasn't been started
    fetch the contents of the first stack player is holding
    fetch the contents of the top drawing in that stack

A fair amount of that code really needs to be put in a unified location
that is not directly coupled to UI; call it ServerModel

The full initialization of the page should look like this:
  create a ServerModel
  create a UI
  create a UIBinding connecting the UI and the ServerModel
  `start` the ServerModel

and no other top-level code should be necessary.
