Does it really make sense to put effort into the router+locator pattern?  It
seems unnecessary to get a first version working.


Other things:
  changing IDs of stacks, games, drawings, users, players so that they are (e.g.) base 64
sha-1s and thus nicer in URLs
  wiring up handlers for this new persistence model
  putting a prepared statement together with its defining SQL in one place to
avoid duplication
