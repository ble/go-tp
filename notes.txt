Structure of the client-side:

Client-Passive
Model
Client-Active
UI

Active client:
  gets initial game state
  makes user-initiated requests

Passive client:
  polls / listens on websocket for game state updates and mutates the model

Active client interface:
  GetGameState()
  GetStack()
  GetDrawing()
  AppendToDrawing()
  PassStack()
  Chat()

ALL OF THESE RETURN `goog.result.Result`s (which are Futures or Promises for
those of you playing along at home.)


The active client and model parts of this design have been basically achieved;
that means it's time to get the passive client right.

How should this connect with the existing comet loop code, if at all?
