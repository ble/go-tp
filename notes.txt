What's our major malfunction here?
Stacks and drawings should have unique URLs.
The mapping from drawing or stack to URL should not be ad-hoc; it should be
an interface specified _somewhere_.

What is this interface going to look like or what will it mean?

More generically than just a drawing or a stack, this interface is going
to provide URLs for objects that encapsulate a resource.

So... Locator?
