Where does it belong?

passive_client.js
  definition of PassiveClient
server_model.js
  initializing `client` with correct URL
  initializing `game` with client
  creation of comet
  creation of PassiveHandler
  coupling of PassiveHandler to comet
  making PassiveHandler's parent event target be the server object itself
server_model.js - some kind of start or initialize method
  stopping `comet` if it's going
  call to `game.fetchState()`
  coupling `game.fetchState()` success to starting of comet loop
  giving back a Result for following on the success / error

HTML page
  convenient namespacing
  sends a test chat
  making the following happen in an appropriate, async fashion,
  keyed off of the `fetchState` success:
    start the game if it hasn't been started
    fetch the contents of the first stack player is holding
    fetch the contents of the top drawing in that stack

A fair amount of that code really needs to be put in a unified location
that is not directly coupled to UI; call it ServerModel
