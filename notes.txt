The full initialization of the page should look like this:
  create a ServerModel
  create a UI
  create a UIBinding connecting the UI and the ServerModel
  `start` the ServerModel (kicks off request for current game state)

and no other top-level code should be necessary.


Why am I throwing away the old UI code?

  direct coupling of ui widget to XHR
  kinda goofy dom assemblage
  ad-hoc high level structure


What are the pieces of the UI?
+ Roster of players
+ Chatroom
+ State of play
+ Player's current task description
+ Drawing to interpret
+ Drawing in progress
+ Stack to review
+ All stacks display 
+ Pass drawing button
+ Start game button
