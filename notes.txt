SIDESTEPPING: one-time URLs
strictly an in-memory phenomenon
user hits up /onetime/<ACTION-ID-HERE>
safe concurrent access to an action stored in a map under the action id
one of these actions plays like this:
  create user w/ alias, pw, email
  redirect user to /game/<GAME-ID-HERE>/join-client


OUTSTANDING FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES:
  + Access to drawings
  + Handler for drawings
  + Handlers for creating users and logging them in
  + Grand JSON event stream

+ ACCESS TO DRAWINGS
An incomplete drawing can only be accessed by the user who is drawing it.
A complete drawing in an incomplete stack can only be accessed by a user who
drew a picture in that stack.
A complete drawing in a complete stack can be accessed by anyone.
+ HANDLER FOR DRAWINGS
Need to grab either the in-memory or persistent drawing, yuck.
Need to ensure consistent access when adding parts to drawing, completing
drawing

+ HANDLERS FOR CREATING USERS AND LOGGING THEM IN
Can we sidestep this by making it possible to issue one-time use URLs that
create a user, set the user ID cookie, and redirect somewhere else?

+ GRAND JSON EVENT STREAM
Yes, please.


OUTSTANDING IMPLEMENTATION/CONVENIENCE ISSUES:
  + Putting a prepared statement together with its defining SQL to avoid code
    duplication.
  + Better testing functionality for constructing HTTP requests and verifying
    HTTP responses
