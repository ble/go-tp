What's our major malfunction here?
Stacks and drawings should have unique URLs.
The mapping from drawing or stack to URL should not be ad-hoc; it should be
an interface specified _somewhere_.

What is this interface going to look like or what will it mean?

More generically than just a drawing or a stack, this interface is going
to provide URLs for objects that encapsulate a resource.

So... Locator?


PERSISTENCE:

So we've been thinking about how the data will be structured on the database side.

There are at least two other ideas to consider:
  * when will data be persisted and read?
  * what interface will be presented by the persistence system?
