OUTSTANDING FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES:
  + Chatting
  + Starting games
  + Access to drawings
  + Handler for drawings
  + Grand JSON event stream


+ ACCESS TO DRAWINGS
An incomplete drawing can only be accessed by the user who is drawing it.
A complete drawing in an incomplete stack can only be accessed by a user who
drew a picture in that stack.
A complete drawing in a complete stack can be accessed by anyone.
+ HANDLER FOR DRAWINGS
Need to grab either the in-memory or persistent drawing, yuck.
Need to ensure consistent access when adding parts to drawing, completing
drawing

+ GRAND JSON EVENT STREAM
Yes, please.


OUTSTANDING IMPLEMENTATION/CONVENIENCE ISSUES:
  + Putting a prepared statement together with its defining SQL to avoid code
    duplication.
  + Better testing functionality for constructing HTTP requests and verifying
    HTTP responses
