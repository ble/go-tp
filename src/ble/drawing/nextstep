WHAT'S THAT NEXT STEP?

Add a handler with get and post behavior for drawings
Write a simple test for it
WRITE A CLIENT FOR IT, TOO


Handler has single field, a DrawingHandle

Add an interface for validation of drawing parts?
Add an interface for validation of other http request bits?

Add an implementation of DrawingHandle where the mutation of the drawing is performed by a single goroutine multiplexing over multiple drawings?
